# Key takeaway 1 : Recognize your level of autonomic arousal (alterness) and adjust
The actions to take (e.g. listening to music, drinking coffee, ...) depends on your own level of autonomic arousal.
And this depends on many factors (your sleep, time of day, other parameters).

It's up to everybody to recognize their level and adjust accordingly.

A high-level of autonomic arousal (the GO pathway) will bias someone towards action and will make someone less good at suppressing action.
So in that state, it will probably be better to turn off the phone, computer, music, ...

# Key takeaway 2 : The sweet spot
There exists a sweet spot for learning that allows one to pursue action (go pathway) and therefore learn but also to suppress undesired action (e.g. distractions).

# Key takeway 3 : The environment counts
A cluttered environment tends to make us more alert because we have a lot of things (objects, sounds, ...) to scan for (threats). This our salience network at work. 

This is why some people that are used to live in cluttered environment (e.g. busy city), when they go to a retreat, become very anxious because their salience network that is always very active has nothing to scan for anymore and therefore turns inwards. 

# Key takeaway 4 : Exercise in the morning and/or fasted state
Exercise in the morning promotes alertness.
Similarly fasted state and particularly low-carbs states promote alertness. This is because carbs are riched in tryptophan and tryptophan biases us towards sleepiness (precursor to melatonin).

Now eating any large amount of foods (carbs or not) will divert blood to your gut and will therefore drive energy and remove that energy availability for other things like learning. 

# Key takeaway 5 : Drinking a lot of water and ingesting caffeinated drinks dehydrate oneself
If one is drinking a lot of water coupled with caffeinated drinks (water, tea), one can dehydrate oneself through loss of electrolytes (sodium).
If that happens (shaky, feeling headache) drinking a salty glass of water can help (provided one does not have hypertension). 


# Key takeaway 6 : Spending 7 to 30 minutes within an ultradian cycle (90 minutes) making errors open up plasticity
In episode 6, Andrew explained that adults learn best within ultradian cycles of 90 minutes. In episode 7, Andrew adds up the fact that one can improve these ultradian cycles by spending anywhere between 7 to 30 minutes making errors to improve this 90 minutes learning bout. 

# Key takeaway 7 : Learn to subjectively attach dopamine to practices that enhance you
Dopamine is the chemical linked to motivation. It's a feel good chemical that makes us want more of the things we are doing/experiencing. 

And one can take that to its advantage by subjectively enjoying something that enhances him. For example, one can learn to enjoy the process of making errors because he knows that through this he is learning faster and therefore getting closer to its goal which is a good thing.

Doing this will create synergy between the dopamine system and the plastic system. 

# Key takeaway 8 : Make your State match your Intent
For learning, one learned from episode 6 that alertness is needed. So if you are too sleep, you can't engage in a learning bout, you can't reach the starting line for engaging in it. Similarly, if you need to engage in learning a bit of maths and you are so amped up you just want to jump aroud, that's not going to work either. Andrew Huberman calls that limbic friction. A mismatch between the State you are in, and the State you should be in for the particular activity you are trying to engage in.

Tools exist to ramp up or calm down the autonomic nervous system and therefore reach the desired state. To calm down, double inhale long exhale can be used. Or engage in a non-tunnel vision. To amp up, super oxygenation techniques can be used. There are many others. 

# Key takeaway 9 : Vestibular system errors open up plasticity as well
Errors in the vestibular system (i.e. balance system) trigger plasticity. Indeed, a correct balance is key for survival. Therefore, any error there needs to be corrected fast. 

However, in order to trigger plasticity, there must be errors in balance on one side but novelty as well. So someone who is skilled at handstand will get zero plasticity performing handstands. While someone who is not will probably open up plasticity after that. First time skydivers reach that incredible state after diving because of that mechanism. However, after some jumps (tens or hundreds) this becomes a habit and plasticity don't open up anymore following a jump.

So it's up to everyone to tailor this opportunity to their personal experience.
