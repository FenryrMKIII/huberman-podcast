# Key takeaway 1 : Dopamine, precursor to adrenaline
Dopamine isn't just the molecule of reward and pleasure. It's the precursor to adrenaline in the body 
and epinephrine in the brain. 

# Key takeaway 2 : The reward pathway : gas pedal and brake
In the reward pathway, dopamine is the gas pedal. It's the things that gets us to be motivated to do something, to 
engage into movement to achieve something, ...

There is also a brake in the reward pathway that is embodied by the prefrontal cortex. Animals don't have much of it. Humans have full of it. Without that brake, humans would be pure pleasure seeking animals. 

# Key takeway 3 : Food, sex, nicotine, cocaine
Nicotine is increased respectively 50%, 100%, 150%, 1000% above baseline following food ingestion, sex act, nicotine and cocaine use. Now one understand why people become addict.

Now what is interesting is that the dopamine release above baseline can be increased before the consumption by just thinking about something. And that's normal since dopamine reward system was made for survival so trigger a desirable behaviour. Of course, just thinking about cocaine won't reach the 1000% increase. 

# Key takeaway 4 : Motivation & addiction : a story of pleasure and pain
For every bit of pleasure (e.g. eating some delicious food), there is an equivalent bit of pain created (craving for the next bit of delicious food). 

Now the issue is that by pursuing the behavior, the pleasure will diminish but the pain will increase. And this implies that the role of dopamine is two-fold and one is more prevalent. Dopamine is involved in pleasure. At first. But then, afterwards, dopamine is involved in putting you into action for releasing the pain. For releasing the craving.

# Key takeaway 5 : Satisfaction. Serotonin, prolactin; oxytocyn
The counterpart to dopamine system is the serotonin system (also linked to oxytocyn & prolactin) which is called the here and now system. It allows you to enjoy the present and stops you from constantly project into the future and seek action. 

And this system is also supported by the endogenous canabinoids that human make. And that's why THC and majijuana have those kind of calming down effects (one could say lethargic) because they bind to identical receptors. Also, this system is linked to forgetting. Hence why pot smokers have not good memory. 

# Key takeaway 6 : Push & pull and balance
In order to enjoy life, there must be a balance between the dopamine system and the serotonin system. If you are high on the dopaminergic pathway, you will always be in pursuit of something. That's good for achieving goals but not so good for enjoying life. Furthermore, some dopaminergic people can achieve their goals through manipulative ways and are therefore not good to be around.

The contrary is also true. Being too far to the serotonin side gets you to be satisfied with what you have, which is good for enjoying life. But then impedes you reaching higher ceilings and goals, ... 

# Key takeaway 7 : Prolactin puts the brake on the dopamin system
Prolactine (and yes it's present in males) causes a crash in the dopamine system. It happens for example after sex. Prolactin is released and impedes the male from mating again. Now this varies from person to person and it varies depending on the context. Novelty (e.g. introduction of a new female) for example diminishes the prolactin effect. 

# Key takeaway 8 : Extending the dopamine arc
After a significant inflection in Dopamine, it's not unusual to feel a letdown. One can diminish that feeling by either not letting the dopamine spark too much or by extending the arc of dopamine cognitively. So for example remembering how great the trip was to whatever big achievement. 

# Key takeaway 9 : Reward-prediction error : How to crash your dopamine system
If you expect something to happen, your dopamine system ramps up in expectation. And if that something does not happen, you have a big reward-prediction error that will crash your dopamine system. 

So never say maybe to a kid. Because he won't hear the word maybe and when comes the time to get the reward, he won't have it but its dopamine system predict it would have it. So ... big crash! (adults are the same by the way)

# Key takeaway 10 : Viewing light late at night : how to do a middle finger to your dopamine system
Viewing light in the middle of the night (so from 10pm to 4am) really puts a dent into the dopamine system. Therefore people who work late on their computers, ... are really impeding their dopamine system and therefore their drive, their ability to pursue achievements in the long term. 

# Key takeaway 11 : Context switching is terrible for the brain
For more information, read the book from Cal NewPort called deep work.

# Key takeaway 12 : The most powerful dopamine release schedule comes from Las Vegas
Gambling ! Gambling is the ultimate dopamine release schedule. Gambling addict will throw away their entire life for the hope of winning the next time.

So the mechanism behind this is intermittent reinforcement. Meaning that you lost most of the time and sometimes you win. 

How to leverage that so that one keeps going ? Keeps achieving its goals ? Reward yourself chaotically. Sometimes three times in a row after three achievements. Then not at all for 10 days in a row. This will keep the dopamine system in check and ensure you keep pursuing your goals in the long term and not feel too big of a dopamine crash.
