Key takeaway 1 : Emotions shape our experience of life
Almost all things that human experience go through the lens of emotions. Therefore, they are really important. However, it's also important to understand that emotions are subjective. Two people certainly don't have the same way of thinking about happinness. So emotions are important and complex.

But even though they are complex, they can be understood and therefore there exists tools to leverage this understanding.

Key takeaway 2 : Emotions are not born from one specific area in the brain
Today, there are pretty good evidence (Lisa Fedmann Barrett) that emotions are not governed by one specific area in the brain (e.g. there is not one specific area that is responsible for the sad feeling as it was thought before).

However, it's clear that emotions are born from the brain AND the body. They arise because there are specific connections between areas of the brain and areas of the body.

Key takeway 3 : At first, there is anxiety
When a baby comes into the world, he as no understanding of the world. He is pure interoception and has no exteroception.

All he feels is anxiety. He does not understand pain, hunger, heat or cold. All he knows is that at some point he feels anxiety and responds to it by crying or cooing and then a caregiver answers to that agitation with a guess (give food, wrap in a blanket, change diaper, ...). So as a baby, you have the model that the world responds to your anxiety.

And so little by little he will start considering the outside world as a way to calm his anxiety. Ok if I cry this much or that much, the outside world (caregiver) calms my anxiety. So this is the first foundation for human's emotional experience.

Key takeaway 4 : Three questions to assess your emotional state
What is your level of autonomic arousal (1 to 10), how are you feeling (good, bad,... the Valence in fact) and how much are you interoceptive or exteroceptive. Those are the three questions that one must answer to have a basis of his emotional state at a given point in time.
