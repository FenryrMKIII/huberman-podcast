# Key takeaway 1 : Stress is a mismatch between our internal and external experience
Stress is a generic response. It was not designed for a particulr thing. So the "typical" explanation that is given that stress is a relic from human's past when we were chased by animals and enemies and that we are stuck with today because it's confused with something else by the brain and body (e.g. pressure at work, ...) is false.

Stress as it exists today always existed. In ancient times, people already stressed about their relatives, how they were doing, ... So it already wasn't just related to animal attakcs. 

# Key takeaway 2 : Since stress is a generalized respose, it offers advantages and disadvantages
Since stress is a generalized response, it has the "disadvantage" that it can easily take over and mobilize a lot of systems. The corollary is that there exists, within ourselves, a lot of pathways to put a brake on stress. And therefore practical tools to mobilize these pathways. 

Everybody is born with tools to control stress. Either to amp it up or cool it down.

# Key takeway 3 : Since stress is generic ... stressors can be physical or psychological
Given that the stress response is generic, stressors can take many forms. Being outside without appropriate clothes on a cold day is stressful. Taking many exams at once is stressful. Two very different stressors, one stress response.

# Key takeaway 4 : The acute stress response
A chain of neurons, called the sympathetic chain ganglia and located in the middle of the body and going from the neck down to the navel (a little bit lower), releases acetylcholine when the acute stress response hits. 

This acetylcholine will trigger epinephrine release at several sites in the body. And then this adrenaline will trigger several things. Either blood rushes towards required parts of the bodies (legs, heart, ...) or to inibite unnecessary parts (digestion, reproduction tissues). 

So the acute stress response will want to make you move. And therefore, dealing with stress requires the capacity to deal with agitation. 

# Key takeaway 5 : Impacting the stress response
The opposite of the sympathetic nervous system is the parasympathetic nervous system. This part of the nervous system controls thing like pupil dilation, face expressions, air channels, ... and it is associated with calmness.

And it has entry points. Meaning, one can influence the parasympathetic nervous system through certain practices. And the most potent practice to activate this system and therefore diminish the stress response is breathing practice

# Key takeaway 6 : Direct grasp on your stress ? Play with your inhale and exhale!
When inhaling, lungs take more space, diaphragm moves down and this causes the heart to have more space for itself. The heart being bigger, the blood is at a lower pressure and therefore moves slower and a group of neurons signal that to the brain which in turns speeds up the heart to counterbalance. The contrary is true when you exhale. 

So ... To calm down and slow down the heart, make your exhale longer or more vigorous. To become more alert, make your inhale longer or more vigorous.

The strength of this breathing is that it does not require practice. It's just a true physical and mechanical grasp on the stress response.

Now, to increase its effect, one can top that up with the physiological side of things instead of just the mechanical side. And to do that, one just need to do a double inhale exhale. Doing this, will inflate the sacks that cover the lungs and will make the exhale more efficient at blowing out the CO2. 

To Huberman's knowledge, the double inhale exhale technique is the fastest way to calm someone down. And it's in fact a reflex that people do for example when they are trying to recover from crying.

# Key takeaway 8 : Wim Hof breathing to combat infection
Wim Hof breathing (Or Tummo or super oxygenation) allows one to mimic a stress response and release epinephrine. Taking a cold shower or an ice bath does the same thing. 

And a study showed that performing such breathing allowed to combat infection very efficiently. And this makes sense given that epinephrine increases our immunity. 

# Key takeaway 9 : If short-term stress is good ... What is too much stress ?
Too much stress is when it comes complicated to get a good night sleep.




 








# Key takeaway 9 : Love blunts the pain
Experiments have shown that when people were thinking about somebody (or something or a pet) they truly love, they are able to withstand higher pain thresholds. Or the pain feels lesser. 

And people obssessed with someone have that effect even greater. 

In fact this is not truly love that blocks the pain... it's more the dopamine associated to that that blunts the pain.

# Key takeaway 10 : Acupunture ... The scientific data
Acupuncture works to deal with the pain. And it does so through dopamine. 

Acunpuncture is now studied extensively. And these studies have shown the close relationship between the somatosensory system and the nervous system as well as the ability through this communication to raise or lower the autonomic state. 
The studies show that depending on the intensity of the signal (heat or electricity or needle) and the location of the signal (where in the body), you can get very different response. So one can't say acunpunture is good or acupuncture is bad. Because depending on how you apply acupuncture, you can get one effect or the opposite. For example, strong stimulation of the midsection (think core) increases inflammation. Now inflammation is generally not desired if everything is fine but if the individual is facing some infection in his guts or stomach, that could be useful. 

# Key takeaway 11 : The IceMan breathing (aka Wim Hof)
Wim Hof practices breathing patterns that (and this has been monitored under clinical setup) can help combat infection or diseases. And this is no magic trick. It's just that the type of breathing he does trigger an increase of adrenaline. It triggers the stress response. And the stress response helps fight infection.

This is an embedded mechanism within humans to help our survival. When conditions are tough (cold, hunger), our bodies increase the adrenaline so that we can be active (search for food, ...) but also so that we don't get sick. And usually, when things get better and the stress response stop (hopefully), that's when people get sick (getting sick after hard period of work ? hard period of exams ?).

So such response and increase of immunity can be triggered by breathing practices but it can basically be triggered by anything that increases the adrenaline (sport practices, ice baths, ...)

# Key takeaway 12 : Injury : don't ice
For an injury (sprained ankle, muscle tear, ...) the typical go-to is to ice it. Well in fact you shouldn't. Ice acts as an analgesic but it slows down the healing process by increasing the viscosity of the fluids, by creating fascia sludge, ... While when injured you actually want things moving (macrophages that carry the debris) and gliding (fascia, adhesions). Furthermore, it has been shown that when cooling neural pathways, the pathway gets numbed down. But when cooling is removed, the pathway triggers again with a greater intensity. In the case of a pain pathway ... With greater pain !

So for an injury, the big three are in fact : sleep, movement and heat. For movement, one wants to make movements that DO NOT increase the pain or the injury. So a slow walk. At least 10 minutes.
