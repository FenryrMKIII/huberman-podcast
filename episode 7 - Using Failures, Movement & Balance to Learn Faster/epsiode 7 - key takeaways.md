# Key takeaway 1 : The way to create plasticity is to induce errors on how one performs things
Repeated mistmatches or errors will induce plasticity.

This behaviour sends signal to the brain that something is wrong. And this creates the right neurochemicals cocktail to trigger plasticity

# Key takeaway 2 : Frustration is the feeling to pursue
When making errors, when not achieving something, generally frustration will build up. And that feeling of frustration is actually the key to plasticity !

So when one feels frustration building up, one must keep going at the current task because that feeling of frustration is actually the signal that plasticity is opening up.
And if one stops doing what he was doing at that moment ... Then that plasticity will serve to match whatever next action follow and this usually is feeling not very well. 

So this is very important to understand. Plasticity is not linked to a task. Plasticity is linked to a chemical bath. And if when that chemical bath is there one is doing something else (another task) or feelign something not good, that plasticity will serve to anchor that task or feeling to the nervous system. 

# Key takeway 3 : Adults can only tolerate small errors. But incremental learning allows for significant plasticity

Experiments have shown that young people can tolerate huge errors and make huge changes at once in their nervous system.

The adult brain can't do that. The adult brain cannot tolerate huge errors e.g. complete change in the visual representation map. 
The only way to get significant plasticity as an adult is to make smaller mistakes and stacks the learning of these incremental mistakes.

In other words, to learn efficiently as an adult, one must undergo smaller training bouts.

# Key takeaway 4 : Failing at basketball to learn maths
When one fails at a specific task e.g. basketball free throws, plasticity opens up not just for those free throws but for any activity. Indeed, plasticity is a state that is not specific to a task. 

So if following the free throws, when frustration has built up, one moves on to what they want to learn (e.g. maths), then this plasticity will be available to learn that one thing.

# Key takeaway 5 : Learning rate is proportional to the emergency
Learning rate (plasticity) can be quite significant as an adult (and mimic young individuals learning rate) if and only if there is a matching emergency e.g. getting food, surviving, ... 

# Key takeaway 6 : Spending 7 to 30 minutes within an ultradian cycle (90 minutes) making errors open up plasticity
In episode 6, Andrew explained that adults learn best within ultradian cycles of 90 minutes. In episode 7, Andrew adds up the fact that one can improve these ultradian cycles by spending anywhere between 7 to 30 minutes making errors to improve this 90 minutes learning bout. 

# Key takeaway 7 : Learn to subjectively attach dopamine to practices that enhance you
Dopamine is the chemical linked to motivation. It's a feel good chemical that makes us want more of the things we are doing/experiencing. 

And one can take that to its advantage by subjectively enjoying something that enhances him. For example, one can learn to enjoy the process of making errors because he knows that through this he is learning faster and therefore getting closer to its goal which is a good thing.

Doing this will create synergy between the dopamine system and the plastic system. 

# Key takeaway 8 : Make your State match your Intent
For learning, one learned from episode 6 that alertness is needed. So if you are too sleep, you can't engage in a learning bout, you can't reach the starting line for engaging in it. Similarly, if you need to engage in learning a bit of maths and you are so amped up you just want to jump aroud, that's not going to work either. Andrew Huberman calls that limbic friction. A mismatch between the State you are in, and the State you should be in for the particular activity you are trying to engage in.

Tools exist to ramp up or calm down the autonomic nervous system and therefore reach the desired state. To calm down, double inhale long exhale can be used. Or engage in a non-tunnel vision. To amp up, super oxygenation techniques can be used. There are many others. 












# Key takeaway 9 : Sleep consistency matters
It's at least as important (and perhaps more important) to be consistent about sleep than it is to "get enough sleep". 

A study showed that for each hour variation (less or more) around the mean, a decrease in 17% performance (for performing an exam) was observed. 

This means that people need to adjust their sleep schedule to their needs. It's better to get consistently 6 hours of sleep than getting 6 then 10 then 4 then 6. 

# Key takeaway 10 : Serotonin supplements can increase the amount of REM sleep
During non-REM sleep, serotonin levels are low. Therefore, taking serotonin supplements or 5-HTP based supplements (precursor to serotonin) lead to increase levels of serotonin and therefore increased percentages of REM sleep.

Take care however that therefore non-REM sleep might be diminished and this has implications too. 

# Key takeaway 11 : Strength exercises tend to increase non-REM sleep
Resistance exercises tend to increase non-REM sleep (motor learning acquisition) throug their impact on the body. Note that one does not need to exercise close to bed to have this effect. In fact, exercising close to bedtime might lead to sleep disruption or phase shift (see other podcast) 

# Key takeaway 12 : Lucid dreaming can be influenced
If one desires to experience more lucid dreams, one can try to tether to the reality through a cue. 

For example, one can draw a red apple on a notebook for several days before sleep. And then maybe during sleep, one will see a red apple and tie this experience to the reality of drawing the apple and push the conscious state into the sleeping state therefore creating lucid dreaming.
