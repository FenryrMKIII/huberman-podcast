# Key takeaway 1 : The way to create plasticity is to induce errors on how one performs things
Repeated mistmatches or errors will induce plasticity.

This behaviour sends signal to the brain that something is wrong. And this creates the right neurochemicals cocktail to trigger plasticity

# Key takeaway 2 : Frustration is the feeling to pursue
When making errors, when not achieving something, generally frustration will build up. And that feeling of frustration is actually the key to plasticity !

So when one feels frustration building up, one must keep going at the current task because that feeling of frustration is actually the signal that plasticity is opening up.
And if one stops doing what he was doing at that moment ... Then that plasticity will serve to match whatever next action follow and this usually is feeling not very well. 

So this is very important to understand. Plasticity is not linked to a task. Plasticity is linked to a chemical bath. And if when that chemical bath is there one is doing something else (another task) or feelign something not good, that plasticity will serve to anchor that task or feeling to the nervous system. 

# Key takeway 3 : Adults can only tolerate small errors. But incremental learning allows for significant plasticity

Experiments have shown that young people can tolerate huge errors and make huge changes at once in their nervous system.

The adult brain can't do that. The adult brain cannot tolerate huge errors e.g. complete change in the visual representation map. 
The only way to get significant plasticity as an adult is to make smaller mistakes and stacks the learning of these incremental mistakes.

In other words, to learn efficiently as an adult, one must undergo smaller training bouts.

# Key takeaway 4 : Failing at basketball to learn maths
When one fails at a specific task e.g. basketball free throws, plasticity opens up not just for those free throws but for any activity. Indeed, plasticity is a state that is not specific to a task. 

So if following the free throws, when frustration has built up, one moves on to what they want to learn (e.g. maths), then this plasticity will be available to learn that one thing.

# Key takeaway 5 : Learning rate is proportional to the emergency
Learning rate (plasticity) can be quite significant as an adult (and mimic young individuals learning rate) if and only if there is a matching emergency e.g. getting food, surviving, ... 

# Key takeaway 6 : Spending 7 to 30 minutes within an ultradian cycle (90 minutes) making errors open up plasticity
In episode 6, Andrew explained that adults learn best within ultradian cycles of 90 minutes. In episode 7, Andrew adds up the fact that one can improve these ultradian cycles by spending anywhere between 7 to 30 minutes making errors to improve this 90 minutes learning bout. 

# Key takeaway 7 : Learn to subjectively attach dopamine to practices that enhance you
Dopamine is the chemical linked to motivation. It's a feel good chemical that makes us want more of the things we are doing/experiencing. 

And one can take that to its advantage by subjectively enjoying something that enhances him. For example, one can learn to enjoy the process of making errors because he knows that through this he is learning faster and therefore getting closer to its goal which is a good thing.

Doing this will create synergy between the dopamine system and the plastic system. 

# Key takeaway 8 : Make your State match your Intent
For learning, one learned from episode 6 that alertness is needed. So if you are too sleep, you can't engage in a learning bout, you can't reach the starting line for engaging in it. Similarly, if you need to engage in learning a bit of maths and you are so amped up you just want to jump aroud, that's not going to work either. Andrew Huberman calls that limbic friction. A mismatch between the State you are in, and the State you should be in for the particular activity you are trying to engage in.

Tools exist to ramp up or calm down the autonomic nervous system and therefore reach the desired state. To calm down, double inhale long exhale can be used. Or engage in a non-tunnel vision. To amp up, super oxygenation techniques can be used. There are many others. 

# Key takeaway 9 : Vestibular system errors open up plasticity as well
Errors in the vestibular system (i.e. balance system) trigger plasticity. Indeed, a correct balance is key for survival. Therefore, any error there needs to be corrected fast. 

However, in order to trigger plasticity, there must be errors in balance on one side but novelty as well. So someone who is skilled at handstand will get zero plasticity performing handstands. While someone who is not will probably open up plasticity after that. First time skydivers reach that incredible state after diving because of that mechanism. However, after some jumps (tens or hundreds) this becomes a habit and plasticity don't open up anymore following a jump.

So it's up to everyone to tailor this opportunity to their personal experience.
