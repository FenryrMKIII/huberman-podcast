# Key takeway 1 : Sleep is our reset button
Sleep is a key period in one's journey because it resets the ability to be focused, alert and emotionnaly stable during one's wakeful state. 

# Key takeway 2 : Sleep and wakeful state are linked together
What one's do during the day (i.e. during wakefulness) impacts when he will fall sleep, how fast, how well he will sleep, ...

# Key takeway 4 : Sleep quality is the product of a combination of behaviours
Sleep quality isn't governed by one unique factor. It's a combination of behvarioral factors that provides high quality sleep.

# Key takeway 5 : Adenosine creates sleep hunger
Adenosine is a molecule that builds up as the day goes on. In other words, adenosine levels are low in the brain and body when waking up and are elevated at the end of the day after e.g. 10, 15 hours without sleeping. 

Caffeine works because it blocks adenosine receptors. And everybody needs to figure out for himself whether caffeine should be part of his regimen because sensitivity varies tremendously across individuals.

# Key takeway 6 : Circadian rythm dictates our wakeful state and sleep cycles and are controlled by cortisol and melatonin
If one has ever pulled an all-nighter, he knows that when morning comes, he will feel more awake than during the night itself altough adenosine has built-up all night long.

That's because the natural circadian rythm embedded within our nervous system drives our sleepiness and wakefulness. These rythms would happen even if one was placed in a cave with no external clue whatsoever of the time of the day. 

Therefore, the key to sleep quality (or solving sleep disorders) is to correctly regulate this circadian rythm.

The circadian rythms are regulated by hormones : cortisol (wakeful signal) and melatonin (sleepy signal).

In most people, a pulse of cortisol tends to be released when (or around that time) the sun rises and is accompanied by a release of adrenaline. The combination of these releases signal the body that it's time to crank up the heart rate, that the day is about to begin. So the pulse of cortisol is the wakefulness signal.

This pulse of cortisol then also determines when another hormone, melatonine, will be secreted about 10 to 14 hours after the cortisol pulse. And melatonine is the sleepiness signal. 

# Key takeway 7 : Sunlight allows one to regulate its sleeping and wakeful states patterns

The circadian rythm, the internal clock, is set through a collection of neurons found in the eye region. These neurons are sensitive to particular light wavelengths (quality of light) and particular light quantity. And the source providing these two particular wavelengths in sufficient quantity are the sunrise and sunset.

Getting those two types of light at the correct times in the day and in the correct amount is vital to setting the cortisol pulse and melatonine production.

# Key takeway 8 : Go outside an hour or two after sunrise and an hour or two before sunset

In order to set your internal clock correctly, you need to go outside without sunglasses one hour or two after sunrise and one hour or two before sunset. This is quality of light.

For quantity, one should aim for 100 000 lux. Smartphones applications (e.g. light meter) are able to measure that easily.  It's impossible to give a length of time because of the many variables that influence light intensity (cloud cover, obstacles, reflexions, ...). If you really want an order of magnitude... between 2 and 10 minutes exposure.

# Key takeway 9 : The longer you are awake, the more sensitive you are to light
It is true that outside light in the morning is the best source of light for setting the internal clock because of (on top of the particular wavelength) the quantity of light. In other words, setting the internal clock through artificial does not work very well (because it takes forever to reach 100 000lux exposure).

However, the longer one is awake, the more one is sensitive to light. After a long day, light coming from screens or artificial lights can actually influence the clock and make one stay awake longer or have trouble falling asleep. 

After 8pm, one should really limit the amount of light he is getting. And between 11pm and 4am, one should definitely not get any light exposure because studies have shown that it suppresses melatonine production. It's ok once in a while but not daily.

# Key takeway 10 : Red lights placed on the bottom of the field of vision are better
Cells that regulate the internal clock are located in the eye so that they react to the upper part of the vision field (logical ... the sun is located in the sky).

So if one wants to design his room to diminish the activiation of those cells because of night lights, one could place the lights low in the room e.g. on the floor and use red/yellowish lights rather than fluorescent lights (these are the worst) and finally use dim lights.

Also, fire and candle lights don't trigger the cells that regulate the internal clock.

# Key takeway 11 : Exercise and food come additionnally to sunlight

Sunlight is the primary driver of healthy sleep patterns and drives away many health issues and mental disorders.

But food and exercise, additionnally to light, can help to anchor the internal clock correctly. Exercising early in the day will tend to make one wake up early. Eating generally triggers wakefulness. 

# Key takeway 12 : How to wake up earlier ?

Get light to the eyes (even with eyelids closed) at the desired time of waking-up (overhead artificial light or open curtains). See the sunrise light (one or two hours after sunrise). Exercise early. Eat early.

Avoid bright lights at night. Don't eat too late. Don't have intense physical activity too late in the day.

# Key takeway 13 : You don't control the body with the mind. You control the mind with the body.
Improving behaviours require action. Action requires using the body. 

Breathing, movement, seeing sunlight, eating. All those tools that can help one setting his internal clock actually involve the body. And this in turn regulate the mind in a positive manner.

# Key takeway 14 : It's expected to have a dip in energy around 4 o'clock
Around 4 o'clock (little before, little after), most people will probably feel a dip in energy.

This is okay. Just go with it. Don't engage in a focus bout or strenuous activity at that time. Rather, take a nap if you can and if you manage it well. Or engage in a non-sleep deep rest protocol such as Yoga Nidra.
